## Lessons Learned

Before starting this project, I spent a day learning Regex! Thus I was so biased in using what I've learned about it. So the solution may not be optimal and scalable. Anyway, **this was good practice for empower My Regex knowledge, Array and String's methodes and  problem-solving in general**.
