It's a simple calculator, **supports the basic operators** (+, -, *, /, %) and **observes the operator's precedence**, developed for training purposes.

## I was focused on 

- Regex
- Pure Javascript


## Lessons Learned

Before starting this project, I spent a day learning Regex! Thus I was so biased in using what I've learned about it. So the solution may not be optimal and scalable. Anyway, **this was good practice for empowering My Regex knowledge, Working with Array and String's methodes and problem-solving in general**.
